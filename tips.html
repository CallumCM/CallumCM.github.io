        <h6 class="title">By: Turnip1234</h6><br><br>
        <p>3 years ago, I was astounded by the power of CGI, 
          I saw people making mind-blowing artworks with this
           godly software called Blender 2.76. After the installation
            was completed, I opened it. I was mesmorized by the software
             but also horrified, <b>so many buttons!</b> What to do? Which
              ones to press? What I didn’t realize was that <b>you almost never
               need more than a few buttons, the others are rarely to never used.</b>
                That experience made me quit Blender for an entire year. But after that,
                 I was on vacation and suddenly. Out of nowhere. it just clicked. Right then. Right there. It just happened.
                  After returning home to Blender, I was astounded to figure out that I was right. More enthusiastic 
                  than ever now, I raced around the internet looking for tutorials.</p><br>
        <p>Okay, enough distractions. This is my list of tips for using fancy software like a pro:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Fancy does not mean > $600. Fancy has no correlation to the price. More often than not, there’s a free software that does the job just as good as a paid one.</li>
          <li>You never use more than 20% of all the buttons on the screen.</li>
          <li>DON'T PANIC!</li>
          <li>Take it 10% slower than you want to go. Trying to build a sci-fi city on your second day is just going to make you sad.If you have the patience to do a long term project, make your dream sci-fi city over the course of 7 months. If you're patienceless like I am, stick to smaller things like a sci-fi space-ship and keep your projects less then 3 days.</li>
          <li>More often than not, the thing you're using has lots of fancy words. Lots. It almost makes me think that the developers of fancy softwares spend time trying to show off their impressive vocabulary. Don't let this stop you, do yourself the favor and make a mental or physical dictionary of all the terms and their corresponding English names. for example, the other day I found this slider in the hair particles menu of Blender called <q>Brownian Force</q>. After playing around with it, I made myself a definition for what it does. <q>Squigglieness</q>. It's that simple.</li>
        </ol>
